I've selected 5 songs that I think succinctly capture the range of my production style. 

1) 8888 features my good friend Theo Kepler on vocals. I'm particularly proud of the layered synth counterpoint and the percussion throughout this song. 

2) Oblivion will serve as the interlude of an upcoming project of mine. I think the dense harmonies on this track make it really hypnotic and interesting. 

3) Redhead was a ton of fun to make; I ended up playing sax, guitar, bass, and piano on this song (as well as singing). The percussion is built around sounds from my "Brownsburg" sample pack.  

4) Many video games include a hub world, a neutral area free from enemies or challenges that allows the player to learn the controls in peace. I have always been interested in the idea of scoring a video game, so I wrote this track as background music for the hub world of a game that my roommate is developing. It features some processed guitar courtesy of my good friend Sanjeev Rao. 

5) Despite its PBR&B influences, Sweet // 1991 is an ode to Appalachia. I recorded the vocal refrain into my laptop microphone in the backseat of my brother's car, having been inspired by the coal towns we were passing on I-70 en route to DC. I have tried many times since to re-record the refrain with proper equipment, but I could never capture the emotion of that first take. So, I decided to embrace the recording's lo-fi quality and built this song around it.
