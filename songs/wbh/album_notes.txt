Worthless Buddha Head

When I was 12 years old, my older brother gave me his copy of The Notorious B.I.G.'s 'Life After Death' on CD, in exchange for a solemn vow that I wouldn't tell our mom about it. I enjoyed music as a kid, but something about this album captivated me in a way nothing ever had before. In retrospect, I think the fact that I wasn't "supposed" to be listening to rap music made it feel more personal, like this was the first musical expedition I was taking under my own direction. 

I understood almost none of Biggie's numerous references to drugs and violence, due to both my own naivety and Biggie's '90's Brooklyn slang. Truly, what captured my attention so firmly was the -sound- of this record. A particularly telling piece of Biggie trivia is that jazz saxophonist Donald Harrison formed a close relationship with Biggie growing up, serving as a musical mentor and even training him as a jazz vocalist. To me, Harrison's influence comes through as clear as day in Biggie's unmistakable delivery; no other rapper from the era held a candle to his mastery of syncopation, phrasing, and tone. 

With much of Biggie's lyrical content going over my head, my first impression of his voice was as an instrument, his verses as extended jazz solos over pillowy late '90's hip-hop production. It was absolutely hypnotic, equal parts nuanced and energetic. The feeling that this mode of listening left me with is what I aimed to capture on Worthless Buddha Head. I tried to treat Biggie as a soloist, letting his rhythmic choices guide the instrumentation that I built around his verses, hoping to recreate my feeling from that first listen a decade ago.
